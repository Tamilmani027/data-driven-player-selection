# Data-Driven Player Selection for IPL Auction

## Project Overview

This mini project focuses on **data-driven player selection** for an IPL-style auction using player performance data from **league** and **international T20 matches**.
The system combines **clustering, regression, and performance scoring** to identify suitable batsmen, all-rounders, and bowlers under a budget-friendly strategy.

---

## Objectives

* Analyze batting and bowling performance using historical data
* Group players based on batting behavior using clustering
* Predict expected runs using regression
* Rank and select players for an IPL squad
* Generate a final auction dashboard

---

## Problem Statement

Player selection in auctions is often subjective and experience-based.
This project uses **machine learning and statistical techniques** to support **objective and data-driven squad selection**, improving fairness and decision accuracy.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**

  * Pandas, NumPy
  * Scikit-learn
* **ML Techniques:**

  * K-Means Clustering
  * Linear Regression
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

* Batting metrics: Runs, Strike Rate, Average, 4s, 6s
* Bowling metrics: Wickets, Economy, Overs
* Player roles: Batsman, All-Rounder, Bowler
* Data from league and international T20 matches

Missing values are handled using **data imputation**.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   League and international batting/bowling datasets are merged and cleaned.

2. **Feature Scaling**
   Batting features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Batting Clustering**

   * K-Means clustering groups players into 3 batting performance clusters.

4. **Impact Score Calculation**
   A batting impact score is computed using:

   * Runs
   * Strike Rate
   * Batting Average

5. **Expected Runs Prediction**
   Linear Regression predicts expected runs based on:

   * Batting average
   * Strike rate
   * Matches played

6. **Squad Selection**

   * Top batsmen, all-rounders, and bowlers are selected
   * Budget-friendly players are prioritized
   * Final squad is generated

## Machine Learning Techniques Used

### K-Means Clustering

* Groups players based on batting characteristics
* Helps identify high-impact and low-impact batters

### Linear Regression

* Predicts expected runs for each player
* Assists in future performance estimation

---

## Data Visualization
The project includes multiple data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to improve interpretability.

### Visualizations Implemented
- Strike rate comparison of batsmen
- Analysis of boundary-hitting ability (4s vs 6s)
- Wickets taken by bowlers
- Economy rate comparison of bowlers
- Squad composition by player roles
- Heatmap representing player-role distribution

These visualizations support the data mining and machine learning results by providing clear insights into player performance and squad balance.

## How to Run the Project

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

---

## Output

* Final IPL squad with selected players
* Player impact scores and predicted runs
* Auction dashboard exported as:

```
ipl_auction_dashboard.csv
```

---

## Applications

* IPL / franchise auctions
* Sports analytics
* Talent scouting
* Decision support systems

---

## Future Enhancements

* Add bowling impact score
* Use Random Forest or XGBoost
* Build a web-based auction dashboard
* Real-time data integration
